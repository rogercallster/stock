Important formulas
==================

**Freecash flow**

```
Freecash flow = EBIT - Taxes + Depriciation and Amortization - Capital Expediture - Increase in non-cash working capital

```

**Expected Growth of Free cash flow**


**Intrinsic Value**

```It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. Warren likes this value called Owners’ Earnings.
 It’s basically how much the owners of the company take home in cash.```

This is how Warren Buffett defines its calculation:

If we think through these questions, we can gain some insights about what may be called “owner earnings.” These represent (a)
 reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges such as 
 Company N’s items (1) and (4) less the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. 
 that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume.



**** >>>>> Owners’ Earnings = EBIT or Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization — Capital Expenditure.
e.g. : apple Apple 2021 Owners’ Earnings = 108 billion+11 billion — 11 billion = 108 Billion
Or, Operating income + Depreciation and Amortization — Payments for acquisitions of property, plant and equipment


```
Other formula of value
Intrinsic value = (CF1)/(1 + r)^1 + (CF2)/(1 + r)^2 + (CF3)/(1 + r)^3 + ... + (CFn)/(1 + r)^n = Sn = a(r^n - 1) / (r - 1) 



```

 expected growth for next five year in average  eg Berkshire has it at 23 for next 5 years

```CF1 (GrowthRate^time-1)/ (DiscountRate^time - 1)```
= CF1(1.23^5-1)/(1.15^5-1) = 1.8153056843/1.0113571875 = 1.794920436356715 X (26.145B) = 46.92B is the max price that I should buy if PE =1

```CF1 is cash flow in year 1, CF2 is cash flow in year 2, etc.```


**There are multiple ways of valuation of a stock but I guess most important at this point are**

``` 
    a) calculate free cash flow averaged for last 3-5 years neglecting any abnormal ups and downs (neglect outliars ) 
    b) calculate book value for last 3-5 years neglecting any abnormal ups and downs (neglect outliars )
    c) calcualte debt (long term + short term)
    d) Buffet scale "divide owner earnings by the difference between the discount rate and growth rate"
```
