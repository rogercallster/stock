Important formulas
==================

**Freecash flow**

```
Freecash flow = EBIT - Taxes + Depriciation and Amortization - Capital Expediture - Increase in non-cash working capital

```

**Expected Growth of Free cash flow**


**Intrinsic Value**
Intrinsic value = (CF1)/(1 + r)^1 + (CF2)/(1 + r)^2 + (CF3)/(1 + r)^3 + ... + (CFn)/(1 + r)^n

```CF1 is cash flow in year 1, CF2 is cash flow in year 2, etc.```
